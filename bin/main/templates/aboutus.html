                <p class="card-text">I am an aspiring software development engineer at Amazon Web Services. My background is in Biochemistry and
                    Military Intelligence as well as International Cooperation and Global Marketing Strategy. I decided to change
                    career paths after seeing the degree to which technology permeates everything. It is also an industry that is
                    constantly mentally challenging. In my spare time, I enjoy playing golf and climbing mountains.

                <p class="card-text">Hello my name is Robert. I come from a background in Army aviation where I worked on helicopters. I worked
                    in aviation as a civilian for a while, but the industry became unstable I decided to transition into a career that would be
                    more mentally challenging and in demand. I took a leap and got out of that field and went back to school to become a developer.
                    I chose software development because I feel like technology is in a position now to improve the quality of life for people on
                    our planet. I want to be a part of creating things that have widespread positive impact on the world.

                <p class="card-text">I am a Software Developer Engineer Apprentice with Amazon. I am a veteran and current member of the National Guard.
                    I’ve always had an interest in software development. It stems from my love of science and desire to learn new
                    things. At a young age, I fell in love with reading. As I grew older, that turned into a love of learning.
                    My main interests have always been the sciences and I loved reading science fiction. I’ve looked to that
                    future in those books as a guide to what we can be and have wanted to help bring that future to now.
