# Team Agreement

### What will your group do when it encounters conflict?

We will foster an environment where everyone has equal say in what is happening and the direction that the team is going. All conflicts will be heard by all of the team members and a consensus will be reached by all the parties involved

### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

Talk to them politely and respectfully in order to determine if they have any fundamental issues that prevent them from contributing adequately and effectively. If that is the case, as a team work to solve the problem. Otherwise make it known to the member who is not contributing how their lack of contribution affects the team as a whole. 

### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?

If a satisfactory solution is not reached amongst the team members then we will bring an instructor in to act as a mediator

### Communication Plan

We will do standup meetings daily and use slack and or chime when we are not working in the same physical location.

### Work Flow

All team members will work only on feature branches and never on the master branch.

Branch names will include the initials of the person who is working on it as well as the feature they are working on.

Commit messages will be descriptive so that all of the other members will know what is being committed.

We will use Github projects to keep track of our progress.

We will work from 9AM - 5PM at  the Codefellows building during project week.

If working after 5PM members will only push their work and create a pull request. Any merging will happen the following morning when the members are together.
 
### How will you communicate during the week daytime?

We will communicate in person

### How will you communicate after hours?

Group chat in slack or over Chime

### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard?

Create an environment where everyone feels safe that they can share their opinions.

### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up? 

Have a non judgemental atmosphere.

### How will you handle feature disagreements?

Have a group vote where any arguments are heard. If that doesnâ€™t work, the group will seek the advice of a TA or instructor.
